#1 Zodiac Sea Wolf

Chris Wright:

My first watch was a vintage Zodiac Sea Wolf baby-blue bakelite bezel, sword hans, silvery 35.5 centimeter dial that shines like a polished silver dollar on my wrist. To clarify this was not my actual first watch. Before it I had a Seiko, a Chinese chronograph and an Indian military HMT Jawan with a badly printed fake dial and a Frankenstein movement rusting inside. But when people ask about my first watch, those aren\'t the ones I tell them about. I tell them about the weird little Zodiac beauty and the inscription from my gal on the back. I tell them about how I rub it for good luck on takeoffs and how I always picture it in mental postcards from the places I\'ve traveled.

70 years ago, Zodiac launched the Sea Wolf Diver. Featuring a caliber 70-72 automatic movement and snap on case back with gasket labeled \'20 ATM. Especially Water Tested\', the new Sea Wolf Diver gained instant popularity. The new sealing system, combined with the thick and highly domed acrylic crystal and longer crown enabled the Sea Wolf to function as the first genuine tool divers watch, rated to a depth of 660 feet. Today, the Super Sea Wolf Skin Diver has been modernized and features Zodiac\'s Super-LumiNova but maintains the iconic shark tooth hour markers and sub 40mm scale that inspired a generation to get out in the open water.

#2 - Vulcain Cricket

J. B. Smoove (Actor and Stand-Up Comedian):

My dad gave me a watch before he passed, when I was about fifteen. He just said, I had this watch a long time. This watch is for you now. Put it on your arm.\' And it was all big and dangly. \'Don\'t worry,\' he said, \'you\'ll grow into it.\' It wouldn\'t fit any good, but I didn\'t want to change the band because my dad gave it to me. You know what I mean? Your wrist\'s gotta grow into a watch when your dad gives it to you. When he gave me the watch, I felt like, Wow, this is gonna be an amazing piece. But when you\'re fifteen, you don\'t respect the watch. I didn\'t have class and style back then. I\'d put the watch on once in a while, it\'d be danglin, spinnin around on my arm. I might even have played a game of basketball in that damn watch. I didn\'t gain respect for that watch until I was damn near twenty one years old. I pulled it back out again, shined it up. It wasn\'t keeping time I took it to the shop. The guy told me he couldn\'t fix it, since it needed some overseas parts. But it\'s one of those watches where I\'m gonna wear it anyway. If I\'m sitting at a restaurant with a friend, they look at my watch, and they see the hands ain\'t movin \'You know, the hands ain\'t movin\' Know what I tell em? \'It\'s okay.\' I pull up one of those cool terms people throw out all the time \'You know what time it is.\' I don’t need the hands to move, because you know what time it is. I throw that metaphor out there. A stopped watch doesn\'t move, but a stopped watch can be useful, when you’re throwing out cool ass metaphors like you know what time it is. You\'ll grow into it, though, is also a metaphor. Your style has to catch up to this watch. You’ll know when to put this watch on. It\'s an accessory but it\'s a piece that defines you. You gotta know when to wear that watch. You gotta know how to wear that watch. You gotta know when to even look at your watch. Sometimes, you got a watch on, but you\'re in a situation where your ass ain\'t got no business looking at that damn watch! I gotta find someone who knows what the hell they\'re doing. Maybe add a little diamond in there, something on one of the hands, maybe on both. But I think it would be really cool to see that watch with a little bit of upgrading done to it. I think it\'d look beautiful.

#3 - Tudor Submariner (since traded for a Rolex GMT)

Todd Snyder (Designer):

My first dive into a real watch meaning, an investment was a Tudor. It was in the eighties. I got a J.Crew catalog and on the cover was this really cool woman wearing a men\'s watch. At the time, I was living in Iowa and I took the catalog into this watch retailer and asked about the watch. It was a Rolex Submariner. They said it cost around 2500, 3000 dollars. I couldn\'t afford that. They told me Tudor, the same company as Rolex, made a Submariner that cost 1500. It had a very industrial look utilitarian, stainless steel. I worked two jobs all summer a tailor\'s apprentice and on a construction crew saved for it and bought that watch. In the late nineties, I traded it in for a Rolex GMT. I was so naive. I\'d heard it was a good investment. I went back to the same jeweler I\'d bought it from, said I wanted a Rolex, and they gave me 2000 for the Tudor. I still have the papers for the purchase of the Rolex GMT and the trade-in of the Tudor. I still look at it, and think, what an idiot. But you know, live and learn. I still have the GMT, so I guess I learned something.

Launched in 1953, the Rolex Submariner is the first divers wristwatch to be waterproof to a depth of 100 metres 330 feet now 300 metres 1000 feet. Its major features, such as the graduated rotatable bezel, the luminescent display, the large hands and hour markers, have been a driving force in the creation of the long line of Rolex divers watches which followed. The Submariner is an iconic timepiece whose renown now extends beyond the professional world it was first designed for. The Submariner, the ultimate standard. As an underwater survival tool, this watch\'s design has been entirely dictated by the practical needs of divers. Since 1953, the Submariner has evolved technically and aesthetically as it has been endowed with features to improve overall functionality. The first watch was a pioneer and its subsequent versions have continued to set the benchmark for divers watches. The Submariner\'s unidirectional rotatable bezel is key to the functionality of the watch. Its engraved 60-minute graduation allows divers to monitor their time underwater. Manufactured by Rolex from a hard, corrosion-resistant ceramic, the Cerachrom bezel insert is virtually scratchproof and its colour is unaffected by ultraviolet rays, seawater or water that is chlorinated. In addition, thanks to its chemical composition, the high-tech ceramic is inert and cannot corrode. The Submariner\'s Oyster case, guaranteed waterproof to a depth of 300 metres 1000 feet, provides the movement with optimal protection from water and dust. The Triplock winding crown fitted with a triple waterproofness system screws down securely against the case, ensuring watertight security. The Chromalight display is an innovation that improves visibility in dark environments, an essential feature for divers. An innovative luminescent material emitting a blue glow is applied to the hands, hour markers and the capsule on the bezel. Hour markers in simple shapes triangle, circle, rectangle and broad hour and minute hands enable instant and reliable reading to prevent any risk of confusion underwater.

#4 - Seiko SKX and Orient Ray

Wes Kwok & Cullen Chen (Cofounders, Nodus watches)

Wes Kwok: We\'d been close friends since high school. In college we were sending photos back and forth of watches we both liked. At the time, we didn\'t have much money. We had to save up and buy one watch at a time. I remember Cullen talking to me about the SKX as a common starting point for budding collectors. I was looking at the sibling watch to the SKX, the Orient Ray. Cullen came to visit me in Boston. That was the first time we\'d seen each other since high school. I\'d gotten him an SKX, as a gift. He pulled this Ray out of his bag and gave it to me. Cullen Chen: These were our first dive watches. Ever since then, we\'ve always loved dive watches, always worn them. That\'s what solidified the beginning of Nodus, even though Nodus was still three years from happening. Wes Kwok: After we gave each other the watches, I think I remember us having a pretty good night. Got a couple guitars out, a couple beers, got back to what we always used to do.

#5 - Hamilton Neil

Eric Wind (Founder, Wind Vintage)

My first mechanical watch was this Hamilton, which was originally a gift from grandmother to my grandfather in 1947 for their wedding. My grandfather was of Swedish-American background, with an immigrant Midwestern mentality. He served in the navy in World War II, in the Pacific Theater. He contracted malaria over there, and was forever hot the rest of his life. He\'d always want the windows open. It\'d be winter out and he\'d be boiling. It\'s a Hamilton gold-filled watch made in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. At that time, Hamilton gave all its watches male names rather than reference numbers, and this one is the Neil. My grandmother was a schoolteacher, and it was a significant purchase for her. My grandfather wore it his whole life. After he passed in 2008, my mom picked it up, got it serviced and gave it to me. I was fascinated you could pull apart the watch and look at the movement. I\'d open it up, remove the dial and look at the movement running. I came across Hodinkee when looking up vintage watches online that summer. By 2010, I was writing for them, and then I started my business. This watch is very much the reason I do what I do.

Watches in the 1940\'s are often surprisingly small. I guess the \'greatest generation\' and their parents weren\'t as self conscious as today\'s tuna can wearing bling enthusiasts sometimes appear to be. The styles back then were more subtle but, to be honest, maybe a little too subtle in some cases as there were some really small watches back then. However, there are exceptions to every rule and the 1948 Neil is one of them. At about 30 mm wide, it has a larger wrist presence than pretty much any other model in the 1940\'s. It was a popular model too as it was produced for five years. The Neil uses Hamilton\'s 80 sized 747 movement which was introduced the prior year. It\'s smaller than the 60 sized 987A that it replaced and that might help create the illusion that it\'s larger than the typical watches from the period. The case is 14K gold filled and the butler finished sterling silver dial features solid 18K gold numerals. The Neil is also one of the first Hamilton\'s to feature a bracelet.  Up until 1949 Hamilton predominantly used only straps. There are a number of models that received bracelets in 1949. The model is pretty popular, even today.  I\'ve wanted to get one for a long time but they usually sell for a price above my typical price for a project watch. However, I recently landed a nice example at a fair price. As you can see below, it was in decent shape. The model is prone to wear to the outside edges of the lugs and this one looks nice and crisp. The crystal on the watch is a high domed glass and actually gives the watch a slight goldfish bowl-effect. The prominent dome is probably one reason why the case is still in good shape. However, unfortunately by protecting the case, the crystal has taken some beatings and will need to be replaced. You really can\'t polish glass crystals like you can plastic. Below the crystal, the dial is original and shows a tiny bit of wear from age but overall still looks great. Here\'s a shot of the 747 movement. It\'s a little hard to tell in the photo, but there\'s a coating of oil on everything. I\'m not sure what that\'s all about but the watch does run which is a good sign. A thorough cleaning will get it back into proper condition. Everything gets taken apart and cleaned up. As you can see below, a good cleaning makes everything sparkle like new again. A fresh mainspring is installed in the barrel and you can see it in the lower right corner since the cover hasn\'t been put on yet. In this shot you can see the effects of my tweaking the regulator to adjust the time keeping. It eventually leveled out at about 7 seconds per day fast. I usually try to set it around there as it will slow slightly as the mainspring unwinds. And here is the finished product, all polished up with a fresh glass crystal and a nice genuine lizard strap. This watch\'s simple design makes it a sharp looking watch in my opinion. This clean, elegant look is still being replicated today by modern manufactures, 60 years later.
